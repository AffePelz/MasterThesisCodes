# MasterThesisCodes
The codes presented in this repository was used to generate the numerical experiments presented in the master thesis. The codes consist of numerical computations of the non-trivial zeros of the Riemann zeta function and the usage of Newton's method, Relaxed Newton's method, Random Relaxed Newton's method and a recently new method called Bakctracking New Q-Newton's method (or BNQN-method for short).
