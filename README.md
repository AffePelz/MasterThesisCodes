# MasterThesisCodes
The codes presented in this repository was used to generate the numerical experiments presented in the master thesis. The codes consist of numerical computations of the non-trivial zeros of the Riemann zeta function and the usage of Newton's method, Relaxed Newton's method, Random Relaxed Newton's method and a recently new method called Backtracking New Q-Newton's method (or BNQN-method for short).

A part of my thesis is available as a preprint (under supervision of Professor Tuyen Trung Truong): https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05834

The file "Tester1" consists of the non-trivial zeros of the Riemann xi function in a rectangle with Re(s) between 0 and 1 and Im(s) between T and T+1, where T = 10^9.
